# Hand-Piano
✋ Hand Piano Hand Piano is a simple HTML-based hand-tracking project that uses the device camera to detect and follow hand movements in real time. It focuses only on tracking and visualizing hand motion in the browser, making it a lightweight and beginner-friendly introduction to hand tracking and computer vision.
✋ Hand Piano (HTML-Based Hand Tracking Project)

🔍 Project Overview

Hand Piano is a basic hand-tracking project developed using HTML and browser-supported technologies. The project tracks the user’s hand movement in real time through the device camera. It does not involve physical keys or sound generation—the focus is purely on detecting and visualizing hand motion, similar to how hands move while playing a piano.
